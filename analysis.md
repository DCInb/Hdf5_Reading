# HDF5 File Reading Method Analysis

## Methods Tested

1. **Basic Read**
   - Simple full dataset load into memory using h5py's standard interface
   - Loads entire dataset into memory at once

2. **Chunked Read**
   - Reads data in smaller chunks to reduce memory overhead
   - Processes data in manageable segments

3. **Memory Map**
   - Uses memory mapping for efficient access without full loading
   - Maps file to memory space without loading entire dataset

4. **Parallel Read**
   - Distributes reading across multiple CPU cores
   - Uses multiprocessing for concurrent loading

5. **Selective Read**
   - Only loads specified column/portion of dataset
   - Most memory efficient for partial data access

## Performance Analysis

| Method          | Small File (<100MB) | Medium File (100MB-1GB) | Large File (>1GB) |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Basic Read     | Fast                | Moderate                | Slow              |
| Chunked Read   | Fast                | Fast                    | Fast              |
| Memory Map     | Fast                | Fast                    | Fast              |
| Parallel Read  | Moderate            | Moderate                | Moderate          |
| Selective Read | Fast                | Fast                    | Fast              |

Memory Usage (MB):
- Small: 0-10MB
- Medium: 0-100MB
- Large: 0-800MB

## Recommendations

1. **For large files (>1GB):**
   - Use Memory Map or Chunked Read methods
   - Avoid Basic Read due to high memory usage

2. **For memory-constrained environments:**
   - Use Selective Read for partial data access
   - Chunked Read for full dataset loading

3. **For fastest performance:**
   - Memory Map provides best balance
   - Parallel Read for multi-core systems

4. **General best practices:**
   - Structure HDF5 files with chunking
   - Match chunk size to access patterns
   - Consider HDF5 compression
   - Profile with different chunk sizes
   - Prefer memory mapping for large datasets
